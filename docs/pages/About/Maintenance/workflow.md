# Workflow
To keep the flow of development and releases stable, the are some rules
that need to be strictly followed


## Development flow
Any changes from external contributors have to be made in the 
[development repository][dev-wiki:repository] via a PR accompanied by
a related issue and a proper discussion to the 'development' branch

If the discussion reaches the consensus about the PR, it then can
be approved, and modified by a maintainer for corrections

If the changes are within the scope of valid reasoning, they will
later pass to the 'beta' branch

The development version of the wiki website is updated only
on the beta branch which resides at 
[wiki development site][dev-wiki:site]


## Main release flow
Periodically every two weeks the changes that reside on the development 
repository in the beta branch will be summed and thoroughly reviewed
for official release in the [main repository][main-repository] by
maintainers and the Metin2Dev team

After this process, the changes will be visible at the
[main wiki site][main-wiki:site]

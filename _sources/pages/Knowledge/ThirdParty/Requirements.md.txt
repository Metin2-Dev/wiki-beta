## Introduction

Before starting to work on your server you need to understand some important things:

    The development and administration IS NOT an easy task. You need some fundamental knowledge about computers and servers.
    You will work with copyrighted/proprietary material. Depending on which country you come from, this may violate applicable laws.
    You can get help from the community but don't expect too much. Use Google (or other search engines) before you ask something that is actually easy to find out.
    This wiki will only help you in case you want to understand the development of Metin2.

Note: General knowledge of computers and servers and even programming languages is not included in this wiki. But it is required to work on specific things of a Metin2 Server. That's the part we want you to use Google for!
